                    <div class="image-caption">Government Model Engineering College, Ernakulam</div>
                </div>
                <p>As someone who once aspired to become an IIT or NIT alumnus, stepping into Government Model Engineering College, Ernakulam wasn't exactly a dream come true. It was a decision made hesitantly—a compromise, rather than a choice. Unlike many who romanticize their college years before they even begin, I had no such visions. Instead, I was plagued with doubts, wondering if this would be a drastic misstep academically.</p>
                
                <p>Still, I decided to give it a try... A TRY—as if I had multiple lives to experiment with on this Earth. I joined with the hopes of mastering coding, web development, app development—you name it. But here's the irony: instead of immersing myself in the world of programming, I wasted time, oblivious to the knowledge that lay before me. The very things I had once aimed to learn felt like leaves on the tallest branches, only reachable by a giraffe—distant, almost impossible to grasp.</p>
                    
                <blockquote>Yet, every journey has its turning point. And so did mine...</blockquote>

                    <div class="image-caption">Finally diving into web development on my own terms</div>
                </div>
                <p>By the second semester, reality hit me—all those "hard things" I feared were actually on my syllabus. What an irony! And to make things even more fun (read: frustrating), my faculties weren't exactly the "teaching" kind. HAAAHAHAAA!</p>

                <p>So here I am, finally tasting the fruits of web development—experimenting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript… and whatever else the internet throws my way. But here's the difference: this time, it's my initiative. Not an assignment, not a syllabus requirement—just me, trying to keep myself on track.</p>
                
                <p>Instead of drowning in regret over wasted time, I've decided to start somewhere, step by step—like a kid learning to speak the Kalakeyan language (minus the dragons, of course).</p>
                
                <blockquote>And who knows? Maybe this "TRY" will finally take me somewhere.</blockquote>
